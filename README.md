# Comment-Toxicity-Model
    i was inspired to create this model because of the kaggle competition for toxic comment classification, which had consisted of different types of hate comments classified into labels depending on their level of toxicity, the labels are ‘toxic’, ‘severe_toxic’, ‘obscene’, ‘threat’, ‘insult’ and ‘identity_hate’. since this covers a very big issue which threatens the overall helath of a lot of people all over the world. confronting this issue with adeep learning  aproach could make 
big impact that would benefit so many planforms and so that buisiness could supervise their services in a more palpable way.
