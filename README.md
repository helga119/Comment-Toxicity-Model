# Comment-Toxicity-Model
    i was inspired to create this model because of the kaggle competition for toxic comment classification, which had consisted of different types of hate comments classified into labels depending on the toxicity of th comment and these are ‘toxic’, ‘severe_toxic’, ‘obscene’, ‘threat’, ‘insult’ and ‘identity_hate’.
